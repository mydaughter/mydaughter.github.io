Socket.IO is a JavaScript library for realtime web applications. It enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for Node.js. Both components have a nearly identical API. Like Node.js, it is event-driven.

In this post, i will post some code helpful for beginners want to learn NodeJs..

**1: Here is a nice little cheat sheet for sockets:**

``` javascript

// sending to sender-client only
socket.emit('message', "this is a test");

// sending to all clients, include sender
io.emit('message', "this is a test");

// sending to all clients except sender
socket.broadcast.emit('message', "this is a test");

// sending to all clients in 'game' room(channel) except sender
socket.broadcast.to('game').emit('message', 'nice game');

// sending to all clients in 'game' room(channel), include sender
io.in('game').emit('message', 'cool game');

// sending to sender client, only if they are in 'game' room(channel)
socket.to('game').emit('message', 'enjoy the game');

// sending to all clients in namespace 'myNamespace', include sender
io.of('myNamespace').emit('message', 'gg');

// sending to individual socketid
socket.broadcast.to(socketid).emit('message', 'for your eyes only');

```

**2: The number has connect to socket.io 
 In Socket.IO 1.4+

``` javascript

let numbers = Object.keys(io.sockets.connected);
console.log(numbers); // ex :4

```

**3: The number has in a channel**

``` javascript

    let rooms = self.io.sockets.adapter.rooms[channel];
    if(!rooms){
        return 0;
    }
    console.log(rooms.length);
    
```

**4: From server , socket can emit to multiple channel.

``` javascript

    io.sockets.to(channel1).to(channel2).emit('pushInfo', 'Hello! I'm TUngns');
    
```

** 5: In future , socket will provider a feature that's join multiple channel.
You can ref here: [https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/issues/2877](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/issues/2877)

``` javascript

socket.join( 'channel01' ).join( 'channel02' );

```

P/s:
I could easily create my own private fork with this simple feature for my own personal usage, but wanted to see if there was more general interest in adding such a feature to the mainline.
Contact with me about that method if you want

Unit 1 A picnic by the river

W: This is the good spot. Let’s stop and have our picnic next to the river.

M: Good idea. Walking always makes me hungry. I’m ready for lunch.

W: We can sit here on the grass. Oh no! Someone forgot to throw these empty paper bags away. There is litter everywhere.

M: Why do people always leave litter around? It’s not a nice thing to do. It spoils other people picnics.

W: I think they are lazy. Or maybe they just don’t care. Look, they are some empty cans and glass bottles under that tree, too.

M: People should clean up before they leave, and not leave little lying around.

W: That’s right. Well, after our picnic, let’s pick up all the litter we can and take it out of here.

M: OK! And the next week, let’s com back with friends and pick up some more.

W: Good idea!
